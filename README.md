# About
I am a physicist with a passion for experimental and quantitative biology. Broadly, my research interests revolve around the development and application of novel microscopy strategies to study the physical workings governing biological processes. Currently, I am a post-doc in the lab of Prof. Johan Paulsson where my goal is to harness the power of advanced microscopy techniques and microfluidics to investigate plasmid replication control mechanisms.
My career in science started in the highly interdisciplinary fields of super-resolution microscopy and biophysics. During my PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Suliana Manley at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), I developed methods for high-throughput and adaptive super-resolution microscopy, to overcome existing limitations in the speed and live-cell compatibility of these techniques. Furthermore, I used these tools to explore hidden features of cellular organelles, including centriolar architecture and stochasticity in mitochondrial division.
